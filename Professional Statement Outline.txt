I am a highly organized professional with a passion for technology and a strong desire to empower others. Leveraging my 30+ years of experience leading and planning dynamic professional development programs, and teaching both in the public and private sectors,  I excel at connecting with and engaging individuals of all ages. My commitment extends beyond just technology; I am particularly dedicated to protecting the most vulnerable members of our community, including our growing senior population and those facing economic hardship. I am eager to pursue a career that allows me to combine these passions by teaching cybersafety and privacy protection strategies, ensuring everyone can confidently navigate the digital world.
